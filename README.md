# Databricks Projects Repository

This repository serves as my central workspace for all **Databricks-related projects**.
It will include code, notebooks, pipelines, and utilities that I build and maintain while working with Databricks.

## Structure

* **/notebooks/** – Databricks notebooks for experiments and development
* **/pipelines/** – ETL and data processing workflows
* **/utils/** – Helper scripts and shared functions
* **/configs/** – Environment and cluster configuration files
* **/docs/** – Documentation and notes

## Goals

* Provide a **single repository** for organizing my Databricks projects.
* Maintain **reproducibility** and **best practices** for data engineering and machine learning on Databricks.
* Ensure code is **modular, reusable, and well-documented**.

## Tech Stack

* Databricks (Spark, Delta Lake, MLflow)
* Python / PySpark
* SQL
* Airflow (for orchestration, when applicable)

## Notes

This repo will evolve as I add more projects, experiments, and workflows on Databricks. Each project will be organized in its own subdirectory with clear documentation.
