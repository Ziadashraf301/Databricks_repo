# Databricks Projects Repository

This repository serves as my central workspace for all **Databricks-related projects**.
It will include code, notebooks, pipelines, and utilities that I build and maintain while working with Databricks.

## Goals

* Provide a **single repository** for organizing my Databricks projects.
* Maintain **reproducibility** and **best practices** for data engineering and machine learning on Databricks.
* Ensure code is **modular, reusable, and well-documented**.

## Tech Stack

* Databricks (Spark, Delta Lake, MLflow)
* Python / PySpark
* SQL

## Notes

This repo will evolve as I add more projects, experiments, and workflows on Databricks. Each project will be organized in its own subdirectory with clear documentation.
